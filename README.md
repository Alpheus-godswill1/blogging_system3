# Let's Start from the Backend to the Front End i.e from the Admin Panel to the Front display Page.

* As I said earlier it contains several sections, which I listed above. 
* So I am going to explain, how I built each section, what bugs I encountered, you will get to know the mindset behind each section and how I moved from one line of code to completion of this amazing project.

# Remember We are discussing the Admin Section.
## Section 1 (CREATE ACCOUNT/SIGN UP PAGE, WHEN USER DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THIS ORGANISATION)
1. Before entering any website as a contributor or an editor or an admin or what ever role a person plays, firstly, you must have a record, or an account with them so they can know you properly. So note no random user can just publish content on an organisation website, it must go through a process.
> There is normally a connection to the database first in any PHP built section, to ensure data communication is gotten properly.
